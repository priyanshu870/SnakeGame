Use your arrow keys to play the Game.<br>
The code requires a bit modification to make "score" look more attractive. Will work on it :)
<br><br>
TO run the program,<br>
1- Copy the code to local system.<br>
2- Compile the code and create object.<br>
3- Call "main" method from the object created.<br>
<br><br>
NOTE : Make sure the textfield displaying score is always focused.
If the arrow keys don't work, just click on the textfield once.
